## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: REQ-ORD-13 — the Order button is disabled when stock is zero

Each item card's Order button (`REQ-ORD-8`) SHALL be disabled whenever that item's stock is 0, so a shopper can tell the item cannot currently be ordered before they click, instead of learning only after a rejected round trip (`REQ-ORD-2`). This is a client-side hint only: it SHALL NOT replace or weaken the stock check the server performs on every order (`REQ-ORD-2`), which continues to reject an order for more units than an item currently has in stock regardless of what any particular client sent.

#### Scenario: the button is disabled at zero stock

- **WHEN** the catalogue page renders an item card for an item with 0 in stock
- **THEN** that item's Order button is disabled

#### Scenario: the button is unaffected above zero stock

- **WHEN** the catalogue page renders an item card for an item with 1 or more in stock
- **THEN** that item's Order button is enabled, exactly as before this requirement

#### Scenario: the disabled state composes with search

- **WHEN** the catalogue list is narrowed by a search query (`REQ-CAT-3`) and a zero-stock item is among the remaining items
- **THEN** that item's Order button is still disabled after the re-render

#### Scenario: an item that drops to zero stock is disabled on the next render

- **WHEN** an accepted order (`REQ-ORD-1`) leaves an item at 0 stock and the item list refreshes afterward
- **THEN** that item's Order button is disabled in the refreshed render, even though it was enabled before the order

#### Scenario: the hint does not change what the server accepts

- **WHEN** an order for a zero-stock item reaches the server regardless — for example, from a client that does not honor the disabled state
- **THEN** the order is still rejected exactly as `REQ-ORD-2` requires, unaffected by this requirement

#### Scenario: the button's accessible name is unaffected

- **WHEN** an item card's Order button is disabled by this requirement
- **THEN** its accessible name still includes the item's name exactly as `REQ-ORD-8` requires

#### Scenario: the quantity input is unaffected

- **WHEN** an item card is rendered for a zero-stock item
- **THEN** that item's quantity input remains as enterable as before, carrying its existing `min`, `max` (`REQ-ORD-12`), and default value, unaffected by this requirement

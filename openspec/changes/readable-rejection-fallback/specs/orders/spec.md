## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: REQ-ORD-9 — a rejection message is always plain English, never a raw reason code

When an order is rejected, the message shown to the shopper SHALL be phrased in plain English. This SHALL hold even when the rejection's reason is not one of the reasons the page has specific wording for, and even when the rejection carries no reason at all — the shopper SHALL NOT be shown the server's raw, underscore-joined reason identifier verbatim, nor a message that reads as missing or undefined.

#### Scenario: a reason the page already has wording for keeps that wording

- **WHEN** an order is rejected for one of the reasons the page has specific wording for (over the unit limit, insufficient stock, an unknown SKU, or an invalid quantity)
- **THEN** the message shown is that reason's existing specific wording, unaffected by this requirement

#### Scenario: an unrecognized reason still reads in plain English

- **WHEN** an order is rejected with a reason the page has no specific wording for
- **THEN** the message shown is a plain-English sentence
- **AND** it does not include the raw reason identifier verbatim

#### Scenario: a rejection with no reason at all still reads in plain English

- **WHEN** an order is rejected and the response carries no reason
- **THEN** the message shown is a plain-English sentence
- **AND** it does not display the literal word "undefined" or "null"

#### Scenario: composes with the live region

- **WHEN** a rejection message is shown, whether it is the specific wording for a known reason or the plain-English fallback for one the page doesn't recognize
- **THEN** that message is written into the order-outcome live region (REQ-ORD-7) and announced the same way

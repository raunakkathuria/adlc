## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: REQ-ORD-7 — order outcome is announced to assistive technology

The page's order-outcome region SHALL be exposed as an ARIA live region (for example, `role="status"` or an equivalent `aria-live` announcement), so that assistive technology announces its content automatically whenever it changes, without the user needing to move focus to it.

#### Scenario: success is announced

- **WHEN** an order is placed successfully
- **THEN** the confirmation message is written into the live region
- **AND** assistive technology announces it automatically

#### Scenario: rejection is announced

- **WHEN** an order is rejected, for any reason
- **THEN** the rejection message is written into the live region
- **AND** assistive technology announces it automatically

#### Scenario: the region announces from the first order

- **WHEN** the page has just loaded and no order has been placed yet
- **THEN** the live region is already present in the page's markup
- **AND** the first order's outcome is announced, the same as every order after it

#### Scenario: a later outcome replaces an earlier one

- **WHEN** a second order is placed after the first, whether its outcome message reads the same as before or differently
- **THEN** the live region's content is replaced with the new outcome
- **AND** the new outcome is announced on its own, not appended to or stacked with the previous one
